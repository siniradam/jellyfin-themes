# Jellyfin Themes
My personal jellyfin themes. Hopefully you find them useful.

I've tried to split changes into separate sections, so you can pick and choose what you want to use rather than having to use everything at once.


## Installation
Add this to the Custom CSS Code input in your Dashboard > General page.
```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/siniradam/jellyfin-themes@latest/comfort/main.css");
```
